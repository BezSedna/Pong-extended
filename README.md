# Pong-extended-
extended version of 'Pong', made in Unity engine

1) This is my first such developed game in Unity 

2) In-game bugs happends sometimes and i'm aware of that but they are caused for example by the ball hitting the bezel of one of the paddles 

3) I have written my own ball physics (bunciness and acceleration) because Engine's material's bounciness didn't work to well 
(if ball hit moving paddle it was accelerating and was really hard to hit. Also, material's bounciness made ball bugs much more common)

4) Game's such simple-looking menu was planned action and is made like that to reflect classical expirience of original

5) If you have any feedback about my code, application or even my english feel free to write to me on my Discord (I would really appreciate that :>)
